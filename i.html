    <h1><center>Taj Mahal</center></h1>
    <p>The Taj Mahal, located in Agra, India, is a 17th-century marble mausoleum built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory
    of his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Renowned for its stunning symmetry and intricate craftsmanship, the monument reflects a
    perfect blend of Persian, Islamic, and Indian architectural styles. Its white marble surface changes color with the
    light of day, creating a mesmerizing effect. Surrounded by lush gardens and a reflecting pool, the Taj Mahal stands as a
    symbol of eternal love and remains one of the most admired and visited monuments in the world.
