            <h2>History</h2>
            <img src="His.jpg" alt="" style="width:400px;">
            <p><b>Bangladesh</b> is a country in <b>South Asia</b>, bordered by India on most sides, <b>Myanmar</b> to the southeast, and <i>the Bay of Bengal</i>
            to the south. It’s one of the most densely populated countries in the world but also one of the most vibrant and resilient.<br><br>
            
            
            The land is mostly flat and <b>fertile, with the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna rivers</b> shaping much of its landscape.
            Agriculture plays a big role in the economy, though the country has also become a major global center for textile and
            garment manufacturing. <br><br>
            
            Bangladesh gained independence in <b>1971</b> after a brutal war with <b>Pakistan</b>. Since then, it’s made steady progress in
            <b>education, healthcare, and women’s empowerment.</b> Cities like <i>Dhaka and Chattogram</i> are busy, growing hubs of trade, tech,
            and culture. <br><br>
            
            Culturally, <b>Bangladesh</b> has deep roots in Bengali language and literature, music, art, and food. It’s a place where
            traditional village life and rapid urban growth coexist—where you’ll find ancient festivals celebrated alongside modern
            innovations.

            <h2>Economy</h2>
            <p><i><b>Bangladesh</b></i> has one of the fastest-growing economies in <b>Asia</b>. Over the past few decades, it’s moved from being primarily
            agricultural to a more diversified, manufacturing-driven <br><br>
            
            <b>The textile and garment</b> industry is the backbone of its growth, employing millions and making the country the world’s
            second-largest exporter of ready-made clothing after <i>China
            </i>. Alongside that, the economy benefits from remittances sent
            home by Bangladeshis working abroad, <b>especially in the Middle East, Europe, and Southeast Asia.</b> <br><br>
            
            Agriculture still plays an important role, providing food security and employment for a large share of the population.
            In recent years, sectors like information technology, pharmaceuticals, and shipbuilding have started to grow as well. <br> <br>
            
            Despite challenges like infrastructure gaps, climate vulnerability, and income inequality, <b>Bangladesh</b> has made
            remarkable progress in reducing poverty and improving living standards. The government’s push for “Smart Bangladesh
            2041” aims to turn it into a high-income, knowledge-based economy within the next two decades. <br> <img src="Eco.jpg" alt="" style="width: 400px;">

            <h2>Tourist Place</h2>
            <p>Bangladesh is an underrated travel destination with a lot to offer for those who like culture, history, and natural
            beauty. The country is filled with rivers, forests, beaches, and ancient landmarks that show off its diversity and
            charm. <br><br>
            
            One of the top attractions is Cox’s Bazar, home to the world’s longest natural sea beach. The Sundarbans, a UNESCO World
            Heritage Site, is another highlight — it’s the world’s largest mangrove forest and the habitat of the famous Royal
            Bengal Tiger. <br><br>
            
            In the north, the ancient city of Paharpur features the Somapura Mahavihara, a massive Buddhist monastery from the 8th
            century. The old capital of Sonargaon and the historic mosques of Bagerhat give visitors a glimpse into Bengal’s rich
            past. <br><br>
            
            Dhaka, the capital, is a vibrant mix of chaos and color — with bustling markets, rickshaws, and Mughal-era architecture
            like Lalbagh Fort and Ahsan Manzil. For a taste of natural serenity, travelers head to the tea gardens of Sylhet or the
            green hills of Bandarban and Rangamati in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. <br><br>
            
            Bangladesh may not have the fame of its neighbors, but its warmth, hospitality, and authenticity make it a memorable
            place to explore. <br><img src="T.jpg" alt="" style="width: 400px;">

            <h2>Culture</h2>
            <p>Bangladesh has a rich and deeply rooted culture shaped by centuries of history, religion, and tradition. At its heart is
            the Bengali language, which plays a major role in national identity. The Language Movement of 1952, where people
            sacrificed their lives to preserve their mother tongue, is still celebrated every year on February 21 as International
            Mother Language Day. <br><br>
            
            Music, art, and literature are central to Bangladeshi life. The works of Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore and national
            poet Kazi Nazrul Islam are treasured across the country. Folk music like Baul songs, with their spiritual themes, remain
            popular alongside modern forms of pop and rock. <br> <br>
            
            Festivals bring communities together regardless of religion. Pohela Boishakh, the Bengali New Year, is one of the
            biggest celebrations, marked with colorful parades, traditional food, and music. Muslim festivals like Eid-ul-Fitr and
            Eid-ul-Adha, and Hindu festivals such as Durga Puja, are celebrated nationwide with joy and hospitality. <br><br>
            
            Bangladeshi cuisine is another key part of its culture — rich, flavorful, and heavily influenced by rice, lentils, and
            fish. Dishes like biryani, hilsa fish, and sweets such as roshogolla and mishti doi are local favorites. <br><br>

            
            Family and community life are important, and respect for elders runs deep. Despite rapid modernization, Bangladesh has
            managed to hold on to its traditions, blending old and new in a way that feels both timeless. <br> <img src="c.jpg" alt="" style="width: 400px;">

            <h2>Food</h2>
            <p>Bangladeshi food is full of flavor, color, and tradition. It’s built around rice, which is the main staple, and is
            usually paired with fish, lentils, and vegetables. The saying “fish and rice make a Bengali” perfectly captures how
            central these are to everyday life. <br><br>
            
            Hilsa, the national fish, is a favorite — often cooked with mustard sauce or fried. Meat dishes like beef bhuna, chicken
            curry, and mutton korma are common during festivals and family gatherings. Street food is another big part of the
            culture, with snacks like fuchka (crispy shells filled with spicy tamarind water), chotpoti (spiced chickpeas), and
            samosas drawing crowds in cities and towns. <br><br>
            
            Bangladeshis love their sweets too. Desserts such as roshogolla, chomchom, and mishti doi (sweet yogurt) are must-tries,
            often served after meals or during celebrations. Tea is the drink of choice, shared everywhere from roadside stalls to
            homes, often flavored with milk and sugar. <br><br>
            
            Regional differences make the cuisine even richer — coastal areas feature seafood and coconut-based dishes, while the
            north leans toward heartier, spiced meals. Overall, Bangladeshi food is a mix of subtle spice, warmth, and hospitality,
            reflecting the country’s generous and family-centered spirit. <br> <img src="h.jpg" alt="" style="width: 400px;">
